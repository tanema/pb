# Ideas for future levels:

- ouput of the program back into stdin
- output is an image with metadata.
- rename the binary
- shell completion?
- find output from inside $()
- stdin to unlock something
- wget image? output photo with metadata
- encoded output
  - base64
  - rot13
  - hex

Probably wont work
- cat out the executable?
- can I do that trick where you change the extention and it works? jpeg, zip
